		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Christian Aldrin P. Labiano, born in Quezon City, is a third fourth year BS-IS student in De La Salle College of St. Benilde. Aldrin is a person of varying interests. He has a diverse set of interests that most would say are unrelated to one another but one thing one can say about him is when he puts his mind into any endeavour, he is able to rigorously thrive in said endeavour. Hobbies/interests include gambling, anime, travelling, sports and computer games. Aldrin, veering away from personal interests, is a fun, spontaneous and noticeably wild person to be with. Be it going on roadtrips, clubbing or just plain lounging at home, Aldrin is able to keep the dullness away from any situation. He is also a former student-athlete ofim the University of Santo Tomas and was competing in various swimming competitions back in high school and first year of his college. Lastly, Aldrin is a person who does not get enough of of life. He is constantly searching for new adventures to go on. As mentioned earlier, he likes to travel or go to clubs and party. He is noticeably wild in the sense that he is extremely liberated. And that is something to be understood in the positive light since this keeps moments with him interesting and spontaneous. Top 5 favorite destinations include: Coron, Baler, Ilocos, Caramoan and Baguio.<p>
